# General (personal) guidelines before submitting a new simulation to Condor

Always check wchich FairShip **branch** is active. For charm simulation, it is currently my **charmsim** branch.
When changing branches or merging new updates from the official repo, **always rebuild FairShip**
Finally, always be in FairShip environment before submitting a condor job (since there is the **getEnv** routine suggested by Annarita)

Keep in general this repository updated, and check periodically for different files.

Finally:
DON'T PANIC. All is forgiven
