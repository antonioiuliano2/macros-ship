First iteration of the alignment is done with the following align.rootrc in a 2cm x 2cm area (started with 0.1 as DPHI and SigmaT for CH1R6)

fedra.align.OffsetMax:                   2000
fedra.align.DZ:                          100
fedra.align.DPHI:                        0.05
fedra.align.SigmaR:                      100
fedra.align.SigmaT:                      0.05
fedra.align.DoFine:                      1
#fedra.readCPcut:                         eCHI2P<2.0&&s.eW>10&&eN1==1&&eN2==1&&s.Theta()>0.02&&s.Theta()<0.1
fedra.readCPcut:                         eCHI2P<2.0&&s.eW>10&&eN1==1&&eN2==1&&s.Theta()>0.02&&s.Theta()<0.1&&TMath::Abs(s.eX-60000)<10000 && TMath::Abs(s.eY-50000)<10000
fedra.align.SaveCouples:                 1
emalign.outdir:                          ..
emalign.env:                             align.rootrc
emalign.EdbDebugLevel:                   1


Second iteration, DZ is reduced from 100 micrometers to 50 micrometers, but SigmaR is reduced to 20 micrometers, while DPHI and SigmaT are reduced from 0.05 rad to 0.02 rad ->OffsetMax reduced to 1000

Finally, if alignment results are good, alignment is performed on the whole scanned surface (swapping comments on readCPcut) -> OffsetMax reduced to 200

NOTE: small differences could be present in the single bricks, especially in
the first one, where the alignment procedure was still in development. Refer
to the alignment_parameters.txt file for specific informations in the brick
folder. Moreover, an additional step sometimes is performed if alignment is
still bad (passing sigmaT from 0.02 rad to 0.01 rad)

Workflow: emalign -> EdbScanSet -> EdbPlateAlignment

OffsetMax is the maximum offset in x and in y to look for tracks
DZ and DPHI ranges scanned by coarce align
DoFine true to do fine alignment
SigmaR and SigmaT define tolerance in position and angle
readCPcut is the cut in reading for the couples
SaveCouples to save couples tree
outdir sets directory  (.. if launched from b000001)
env is the name of the env file to be looked for (align.rootrc)
EdbDebugLevel is the default debug level
