I am tired of not remembering why I changed a macro and when. Let's see if this fancy DVS can help me!

Nusrv9 cannot connect to GitHub repository server. Adding a second repository on GitLab. 
Therefore, when I need to connect my modifications to the nusrv9 scripts, I need to do

git pull

git fetch gitlab

git merge gitlab/master #to merge with modifications from github

git push gitlab #saving on gitlab

git push origin #saving on gitlab

Then git pull as usual
